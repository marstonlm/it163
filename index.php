        <h1>Welcome <span id="namechange">Hiker</span>!</h1>
      <p>We are a group of outdoor enthusiasts sharing our joy and passion with being outdoors with our Emerald City community. Just because we live in city doesn't mean we give up our joy of being outside and hiking. We welcome every person interested in joining one of our groups for a fun urban hike. We stand for equal opprotunity in enjoying what our beautiful city has to offer and encourage any and all to join this amazing community. We strive to build meaningful interpersonal relationships while partaking in our shared love of the outdoors. Please subscribe to our newsletter and don't hesitate to contact one of our lead volunteers with any questions you have. Let's get hiking! </p>
