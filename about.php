        <p class="justify-text">Emerald City UHC’s adventure guides consists of approximately seven old and new core volunteers. Non-hierarchical committees meet regularly to organize and plan hikes, events, and activities.
        </p>
        <p class="justify-text">Our culture of peer-to-peer learning supports new volunteers who are motivated to become adventure guides. In addition, about 15 regular volunteers help behind the scenes with upkeeping our social media, ensuring our website is up-to-date,
            reaching out to the community. They represent many age groups, ethnicities, and physical abilities.</p>
        <p class="justify-text"><strong>NOTE TO GUIDE VOLUNTEERS:</strong> While we have primary group leads, we actively look for people willing to guide groups when the main leads are not available and to allow for more scheduling opprotunities for the community.
            We do informal interviews, follow along hikes with the lead, and an indentity verification process to ensure safety of everyone involved. Thank you so much for you interesting in helping guide our community.</p>
