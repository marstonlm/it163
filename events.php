              <p class="card-text justify-text"> Human guide Luann and pupper guide Abby take you on an urban adventure that starts on the trail overlooking Union Bay and connects to the Burke-Gilman trail going north to Magnusson-Park and ending at the large off-leash dog park. One way walks are about 3 miles. We have varied options to returning to the meetup site, including a small group (with dogs that have higher energy needs) that does a return walk the whole way (for a total of 6 miles), a bus line directly back to Husky stadium via the #75 bus (departs every 30 minutes), and we coordinate a carpool system with a select few volunteers who will park at Magnusson before hand to take people and pups back to the meeting spot. Socialization and excersize for both humans and pups are our focus, while keeping the urban traffic exposure to a minimum while we hike.  </p>

We take a midway point break at <a href="http://fremontbrewing.com" target="_blank">Fremont Brewing Urban Beer Garden</a> to cool down with refreshing local brew before heading back down to South Lake Union. The 2nd half of the adventure continues over the Fremont bridge to the waterfront on Westlake completing the loop and ending the hike at <a href="https://www.whiteswanpublichouse.com/">The White Swan Public</a> House patio for food and drinks to cool down.</p>
